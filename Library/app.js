// Model a library using objects. *
// A library contains shelves. Shelves contain books. Books have an author and a title. Include methods to add and remove a shelf, and methods to add/remove a book. Use a modular approach so that each type of object is contained in its own file. Add any additional functionality you think is appropriate. Create a "main" file that demonstrates the capabilities of your library.

// Library = [];

// Shelves

// Books = {
//   author: ""
//   title: ""
// }

var addShelf = function() {

}

add shelf (qty, bookqty)
